                <p>I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!

                </h5>
                <p>The best Harry Potter film in the entire series. The acting from Radcliffe, Watson and Grint is on point here. The plot focuses on the history of Harry's near death experience as a baby and reveals the truth about who betrayed his parents to the dark lord. I love the music from John Williams (his last work in the franchise). I adore the camera work and SFX, plus the directing by Alfonso Cureon, is as inspiring as it is creative. The opening scenes are dramatic and humorous, the development of the characters is raw and understandable and perhaps for the first time in this series, the characters and locations feel like the exist in the real world. The tone is dark and gritty when it needs to be, but also capable of genuine laughs. From the loveable Hagrid, to the devious Draco Malfoy and the mysterious Sirius Black, everyone is top tier.</p>

                    What I viewed today is one of the best cinematic experience that I ever experienced in my life.Today for the first time I leaned to watch the movie "GRAVITY". Frankly speaking for the first thought of my mind I thought it would be an average movie.But now I can proudly say that I had made the right choice to watch.And it is far beyond than excellence.Sandra Bullock just acted beyond any human imagination.Really hats off to her.The effects made by the director from Mexico is quite phenomenal.The effects were quite damn extraordinary.The movie was lot long.But I loved every scene and watched it very minutely without even looking to any person while I was seeing the movie.
